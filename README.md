### Sample Nano-Lua-Dictionary Project (Xcode)

This is just a sample Xcode project for [Nano-Lua-Dictionary](https://github.com/Goles/Nano-Lua-Dictionary), a very very small library to create KV Lua Dictionaries from C/C++

Currently using [Lua 5.2.1](http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.2.1.tar.gz)

Have Fun! :)

```
Note: If you don't have Xcode you can still take a look at lua_test/main.c and lua_test/tableprint.lua
```
